			<p>The management team of MJS consists of four students at University of California, Irvine.
			We have joined forces in trying our luck in the shoe selling business and are hoping to change
			the game in the shoe selling industry. Our goal is to provide availability to the latest and 
			greatest styles, making the process of taking shoes off the shelves and putting them on your feet
			a breeze!</p>
